# The LUDVIG Journey ⚙️

Welcome to **The LUDVIG Journey**!!

This is a personal passion project which is a continuation of a collaborative endeavor my friend and I started in grade 8. Here, I will document the process of creating my very own virtual assistant - **LUDVIG**.

## 🌟 Vision

Have you ever had any technological inconveniences in your daily life, which neither you nor your cable operator can explain? 

For example, when the WiFi cuts out sometimes but your internet provider says everything's fine. Or when your printer doesn't want to work, but after a couple of painstakingly long troubleshooting sessions, everything's up and running again. 

We've all been there, but now, let LUDVIG be there too. Because LUDVIG isn't just another AI assistant. It’s a long-term project aimed at building a modular, extensible, and intelligent system capable of:

- Providing Phd level depth about any day-day tech. questions 
- Analysis of environmental factors affecting the issues faced
- Local file and data interaction
- And much more!
